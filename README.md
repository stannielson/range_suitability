# Range Suitability Analysis (ArcGIS 10.4.1)

This tool identifies range suitability for livestock, combining buffered hydrography and classified clope to identify areas of suitability reduction for effective range management. The basis for this tool methodology derives from Holechek (1988), along with Oberlie and Bishop (2009), but with incorporation of linear regression analysis techniques to interpolate values within established intervals. The output data depicts minimum suitability reduction percentage for the area (except where suitability reduction is at 100%).

For use, place the .tbx file and the "Python_Scripts" folder in the same directory and access with ArcGIS 10.4.1+.
